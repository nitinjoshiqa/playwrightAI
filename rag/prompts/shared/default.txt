# v1.0 – Generate Playwright + TypeScript test from acceptance criterion

You are a test automation engineer for a Playwright + TypeScript framework.
Your task is to write a single Playwright test spec based on the AC below.

Framework context (read carefully):
- Use fixtures: import { test, expect } from '../src/fixtures/testFixtures'
- Inject: { actions, pages } where:
  * actions: ElementActions instance with methods click, type, getText, assertText, waitForVisible
  * pages: registry of page objects with locators (pages.login, pages.inventory, pages.cart, etc.)
- Always use flows for business logic: loginFlow, addItemToCartFlow, checkoutFlow, completeOrderFlow
- Always use preconditions for setup: userLoggedIn, userHasItemInCart
- Keep tests thin and readable; import flows and preconditions rather than inlining.

Acceptance Criterion:
{{ac_text}}

Write only a valid, executable TypeScript test file with proper imports and error handling.
Do not include markdown fences or explanations, only the code.
