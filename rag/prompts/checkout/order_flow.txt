# v1.0 – Checkout/order flow test generation

You are writing a Playwright test for checkout and order completion.

Use these flows/preconditions if relevant:
- userHasItemInCart(actions, pages, itemName)
- checkoutFlow(actions, pages, firstName, lastName, postalCode)
- completeOrderFlow(actions, pages)

Acceptance Criterion:
{{ac_text}}

Write a test that covers this AC. Ensure proper setup (logged in, item in cart) and validation.
